# Petrophysics-Python-Series
This series of notebooks is used to explain the basics of loading well data, displaying it an dcarrying out basic calculations.

This series consists of:

1. Loading and Displaying Well Data  
2. Displaying a Well Plot with matplotlib  
3. Displaying histograms and crossplots  
4. Displaying core data and deriving a regression  
5. Petrophysical Calculations  
6. Displaying Formations on Log Plots  
7. Working with LASIO

### Still to come
- Prediction of missing data using Machine Learning
- Poro-perm resgression analysis
- Data QC 
- More working with LAS files
- Pickling
- Interactive Petrophysical Plotting

### Suggestions
If you have any suggestions of what you would like to see, please raise a new issue and I will put something together.
