# Petrophysics-Python-Series
This series of Jupyter Notebooks take you through various aspects of working with Python and Petrophysical data.

This series consists of:

1. Loading and Displaying Well Data  
2. Displaying a Well Plot with matplotlib  
3. Displaying histograms and crossplots  
4. Displaying core data and deriving a regression  
5. Petrophysical Calculations  
6. Displaying Formations on Log Plots  
7. Working with LASIO

## Still to come

- Prediction of missing data using Machine Learning
- Poro-perm resgression analysis
- Data QC 
- More working with LAS files
- Pickling and Unpickling
- Interactive Petrophysical Plotting
